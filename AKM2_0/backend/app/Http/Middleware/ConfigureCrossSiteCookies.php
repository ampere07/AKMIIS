/**
 * Make the session and CSRF cookies survive an in-app browser.
 *
 * The SPA (sync.akmiis.com) and the API (backend.akmiis.com) are different
 * hosts. A normal browser treats them as the same site, because they share the
 * registrable domain, so a `SameSite=Lax` cookie is sent with the SPA's API
 * calls and everything works.
 *
 * An in-app browser — Messenger's above all — does not give that guarantee. It
 * is a WebView with its own cookie policy, and the ones that restrict
 * cross-host cookies drop a Lax cookie set by a host other than the page's.
 * The result is a session cookie the server sets and the browser never returns:
 * login appears to succeed, and the next request is a 401.
 *
 * `SameSite=None; Secure` is the attribute pair that says "send this on
 * cross-site requests too", and it is what the WebViews honour. It is strictly
 * more permissive than Lax, so nothing that worked before can stop working.
 *
 * WHY A RESPONSE REWRITE RATHER THAN CONFIGURATION
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Setting SESSION_SAME_SITE_COOKIE has no effect on API routes. Sanctum's
 * EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful calls configureSecureCookieSessions(),
 * which assigns `session.same_site = 'lax'` at runtime on every request,
 * overriding config and .env alike. Rewriting the cookies on the finished
 * response is the one place that cannot be overridden afterwards.
 *
 * Registered first in the global stack so its response half runs last, after
 * every cookie any middleware or route has added.
