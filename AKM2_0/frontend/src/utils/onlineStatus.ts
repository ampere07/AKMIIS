 *
 * These two questions are unrelated and were previously answered from the same field:
 * the panels derived BOTH the account status and the session status from
 * `billingStatusId`, so a paid-up subscriber whose modem was unplugged still showed
 * as Online, and the account status itself was inverted — the backend treats
 * `billing_status_id = 1` as Active (see RadiusReconnectionService and
 * PaymentWorkerService, and `INACTIVE_BILLING_STATUS_IDS = [2, 3, 5]` in
 * RadiusReconciliationService), while the panels tested for `=== 2`.
 *
 * Both helpers prefer the value the API already resolved and only fall back to the id
 * when it is absent, so the mapping lives in one place instead of six.
